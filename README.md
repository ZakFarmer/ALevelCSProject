# ALevelCSProject
This is the repository for my A Level Computer Science project.

## Overview
This project is a remake of a very old project of mine called DevSocial. The aim of that project was to create a social network tailored to developers. While I did get far-ish in that project, I'll be remaking it for my A Level Computer Science project to attempt to complete the project and avoid making the mistakes I made before.

## Features
The basic features of the project will be the same as any social network, such as:
- User Profiles
- Likes
- Comments
- Posts
- etc.

The features that will be implemented to make the site developer-oriented will be:
- GitHub/BitBucket/etc. integration (repos can be shown on the user's profile)
- Code formatting for posts
